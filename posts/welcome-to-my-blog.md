## About me

I'm Adit, a computer fanatic who loves everything about computers, and I want to know everything I can about computers and technology in general. Besides that, I'm also a [Potterhead](https://www.yourdictionary.com/potterhead), an avid reader, and enjoy writing as well.

I decided to make a blog website so I can share the things I know, and learn in the future, for the world to read. Most of my blog's will be about programming, but I may occasionally write about other topics if I want to.

## Technical details

For all you techy people who want to know the technical details of this site, it's developed using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can find the Github for it [here](https://github.com/YeffyCodeGit/adit-journal).

If you want to learn how to make a blog site similar to this, check out the [tutorial on the NextJS site](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

## Conclusion

That's basically all I have to say for this intro blog, I will probably be posting at least once a week on here, or maybe even more. I hope you enjoy your stay here, and learn something new!
